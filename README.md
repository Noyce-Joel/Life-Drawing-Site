## Life Drawing Site

This is the alternative version of a website I built for a client based in Sheffield. The site provides information about the workshops and enables customers to book onto the events through the website using event brite. It also offers a direct method of contacting the business owner. I built my own email service using nodemailer for messaging in order to avoid subscription costs to an email api. I animated lots of the ui to emphasise the creative nature of the workshops. I felt that adding animations that draw in were appropriate based on the theme of the workshops.
